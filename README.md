Robert F. 'Bob' Denison
DELAND - Robert F. "Bob" Denison, 57, of North Garfield Avenue, died March 3, 2000, at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Treatment Center in Tampa, after a battle with cancer.
.Mr. Denison worked for radio station WHCU and Cornell University for nearly 35 years as an engineer and radio personality.
He was most proud of his engineering accomplishments. In 1987, when the radio station was sold, he transferred to Cornell's Educational Television Center in Media Services on the state campus, where he served as a broadcast engineer. He was engineering director 1987-94.
He also worked with the cooperative extension, designing and overseeing the installation of a statewide satellite network, and was instrumental in locating a distance learning downlink site in nearly every county in New York.
Born in Ithaca, N.Y., he moved to DeLand in 1994, where he was director of engineering at BAF Communications Corp. In that position, he headed the team for the design, building and integration of broadcast television vehicles that are used worldwide.
Mr. Denison graduated from Ithaca High School in 1960, where he was involved with the award-winning Accent on Youth. In April 1997, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, composite non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He developed a Web site chronicling his illness and treatment, and linking to many cancer-information Web sites.
He is survived by his wife, Cheryl Nash Denison; his mother, Rose Osvath of Ithaca; two daughters, Megan Marie Denison of Ithaca and Marcy O'Malley Brandt of Oneonta, N.Y.; a son, Kelly Cole-Denison of Ithaca; a sister, Kathleen Denison Overbaugh of Trumansburg, N.Y.; a brother, Donald Denison of Ithaca; two grandsons, Tucker and Austin Brandt of Oneonta; and several nieces and nephews.
A memorial service is set for 2 p.m. Friday, March 10, at First United Methodist Church of DeLand, 115 E. Howry Ave
Memorial donations may be made to Moffitt Cancer Center Foundation, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612.

By JERRY JONES ITHACA -- Area high school pupils learn broadcasting in a unique way: They write, direct and produce their own weekly show. The program, entitled "Accent on Youth," is broadcast at 9:30 a.m. Saturdays on WHCU (870 AM, 97.3 FM)...Conceived d6 years ago by the station's program manager, Joseph A. Short, it was originally called "Youth Behind the Eight Ball." Initially designed to give broadcasting experience to high school pupils and to "expose" young talent, the program has accentuated radio-journalism of late and has dropped the talent show facade. The program has been sponsored since its inception by the Adding Machine Division of the National Cash Register Company, located in Ithaca. The unusual factor in this activity is the fact that the pupils write and produce the show by themselves, with only a technical adviser from the radio station in attendance. "Accent" is recorded early Friday nights to be broadcast the next morning. After the show has been taped, a staff meeting is held to plan future shows. Running the "really big shew" are the two co- managers, Jack Fei and Ron Feudenheim and secretary Sandy Muraca, all of Ithaca. Subordinate departments include news, sports, editorials, publicity and commercials. Actual production is handled by the engineers, who are trained by WHCU, enabling them to run the control room on their own. They are supervised by Accent's adviser, Bob Denison.
